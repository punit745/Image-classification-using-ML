# Image-classification-using-ML

## Project Overview
This README documents my internship project focused on implementing an image classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The project leverages the CIFAR-10 dataset, a standard dataset for image recognition tasks, to classify images into one of ten categories.

## Objective
  The primary objective of this project was to:

    Understand the basic and advanced concepts of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL).
    Implement image classification models using CNN and ANN architectures.
    Explore the performance of different models on real-world datasets.

**Deep Learning Fundamentals**
    Understanding Neural Networks and their architectures.
    Backpropagation and optimization techniques like Adam and SGD.
    Overfitting, underfitting, and regularization methods

## Dataset: CIFAR-10
    **The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of:**

    60,000 images categorized into 10 classes, each with 6,000 images.
    Image dimensions of 32x32 pixels with RGB channels.
    Classes include airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks.

## Tools and Libraries

    **Programming Language:** Python
    **Libraries:** TensorFlow, NumPy, Matplotlib, Pillow, Streamlit

## Implementation Highlights
    
    **CNN Architecture**
          Input Layer: Accepts 32x32 RGB images.

          Pooling Layers: Reduces feature dimensionality.
          Fully Connected Layers: Maps extracted features to output categories.
          Activation Function: ReLU for hidden layers, Softmax for output.
    **ANN Architecture**
          Input Layer: Accepts flattened image data (3072 features).
          Hidden Layers: Multiple dense layers with ReLU activation.
          Output Layer: Softmax activation for classification.

## Key Features of the Project

    Successfully classified images into ten distinct categories with significant accuracy.
